Cedar and light hay smell

Lightly musty a bit of hay, slight chocolate maybe a little milky. Light retro hale giving maybe a touch of honey sweetness but very light. Quite a short finish.

Quite tightly packed. Three PerfecDraw pokes and pull to open up draw 6 minutes in.

Had one touch up of the burn towards the end of the first third

Second third starts with white pepper more prominent and maintains hay/grassy and cedar notes although the latter is taking a bit of a back seat. Finish is longer now and some spice on the retro hale. Very smooth smoke.

When I removed the first band there was a crack in the wrapper from the bottom of the first band all the way to the burn line. 

The final third the spice picked up in both flavour and retro hale. The cedar is almost gone and the grassy/hay was there with a touch of pepper. The crack expanded as the cherry slowly came down and so I had to touch up every so often the random wrapper bit sticking up. Flavour didn’t seem so affected by it. Much longer finish, with water not even washing it out.

Progressed from medium body to medium full body as I got down to the last inch. No strength at all that I could detect.

All in all a wonderful flavoursome smoke without major transitions but small shifts in the flavour notes present though the cigar. I would smoke again.
